# Days_of_the_week_project
In week four, I developed a Java project to demonstrate the use of enums and basic object-oriented concepts. The project includes:

Enum DaysOfWeek: Represents all days of the week.
Superclass Week: Prints all the days of the week.
Subclass Weekend: Inherits from Week and filters out weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).
Key concepts showcased:

Enum usage to capture days of the week.
Inheritance in Java.
Basic object-oriented programming principles.
